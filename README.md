- Hide if unlearnable
- Hide if already known
- Works on linked tradeskill spells

## Build your database

Due to Blizzard API limitations, the addon cannot discover your professions by itself.

In order to work properly, the addon needs to see at least once every crafting frame on every character you want to track.
This will build an internal database of your professions.

Also, you may want to open the crafting frame to refresh the database after learning a new craft.

The age of the internal database can optionaly be displayed on full mode.

## Commands

- None, but you can alter the display in interface addon options
